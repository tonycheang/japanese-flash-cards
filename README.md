This site was built with language learning in mind, where learners can have up to thousands of cards across a variety of topics. Each flashcard can have multiple tags (e.g. shopping, cooking, easy, fruit, phonetic translation). Learners can select a group of active tags to build a customized study session.

## Technologies & Features

Created using React, Node.js, Express, and Postgres.  

* Automatic feedback on correctness
* Adding, deleting, and modifying cards and their tags
* Selection of a group of active tags
* Registration and forgot password flow
* Remote saving to database (up to 5 MB)
* A default deck of all Japanese hiragana and katakana

> Note: Server repository is a private "super-module".

## Future Plans

When time permits, I have the follow features in mind:

* Boolean tags query - combine tags using AND, OR, NOT 
* Performance statistics
* Spaced repetition review
