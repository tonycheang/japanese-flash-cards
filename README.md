> Hosted [here](https://tagged-flashcards.herokuapp.com/). Please wait a few seconds for Heroku to start up the site if it doesn't immediately load.  

This site was built with language learning in mind, where learners can have up to thousands of cards across a variety of topics. Each flashcard can have multiple tags (e.g. shopping, cooking, easy, fruit, phonetic translation). Leaners can select a group of active tags to build a customized study session.

# Features

* Automatic feedback on correctness
* Adding, deleting, and modifying cards and their tags
* Selection of a group of active tags
* Registration and forgot password flow
* Remote saving to database (up to 5 MB)
* A default deck of all Japanese hirgana and katakana

> Note: Server repository is a private "super-module".

# Future Plans

Should inspiration strike and time permit, I would add the follow features:

* Boolean tags query - combine tags using AND, OR, NOT 
* Performance statistics
* Spaced repetition review

# Contribution

I primarily created this site for personal learning and usage.
